# Cart Pole Problem with Monte Carlo

This is a simple project that seeks to tackle the cart pole problem with reinforcement learning. In the original setting, the pole falls only after 27 iterations of cart move. In the notebook, it was found that by using an off-policy Monte Carlo reinforcement learning algorithm, the iterations increases from 27 to 131 iterations.
